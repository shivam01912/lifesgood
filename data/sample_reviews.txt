Average food. Not so great to be very honest. Came here for breakfast. It was not not satisfactory, though the presentation of food was good. Dessert was not bad.
We have been to pizza bakery multiple times so thinking of Italian pizza we went to this brik oven. Had high expectations but after trying their food felt dejected. We ordered Parmesan cheese fries, it was soo salty and the cheesy garlic bread was just tasteless ( no salt) and they did not even serve some dip with breads. Pizza was ok ok and Only the shakes were tasty.
A beautiful place serving really well made food with fresh ingredients. Visit early on a weekend morning (8am - 11am) for a great breakfast menu in a beautiful, quiet, green place. Recommend - steak sandwich
